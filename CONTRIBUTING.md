## Setup

### Clone the repo

First you need to clone the repository somewhere on your local machine and switch to the created project directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:krieselreihe/natr.git
cd natr
```

### Node version

To develop _natr_ you need at least a version 10 or higher of node. You can check this by running:

```bash
$ node --version
v10.16.0
```

### Package manager

Next you need to ensure that you have a [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) version installed larger than 3 (pnpm is a fast npm/yarn alternative). You can test this by running:

```bash
$ pnpm --version
3.5.2
```

If you do not have pnpm installed or an old version of it, you can install or upgrade by running:

```bash
curl -L https://unpkg.com/@pnpm/self-installer | node
```

### Install dependencies

To install all the necessary dependencies to develop _natr_ run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Now you're good to go ðŸŽ‰

## Common commands

### Run tests

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Show test coverage
pnpm run coverage

# Lint the application
pnpm run lint
```

### Format the code

To format the code use:

```bash
pnpm run format
```

To check for formatting issues inside the code run:

```bash
pnpm run format:check
```
